    "# The Effects of Corporate Tax Policy Reforms  \n",

    "### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to develop a programme that calculates the effects of changes in corporate tax policy on tax revenues for different jurisdictions. Then to create an interactive graphic which displays these effects with adjustable variables. This 'create your own policy' graphic will display a range of tax revenue change outcomes based on the percentage of corporations' global profits taxed, and the percentage of taxing rights that are apportioned on sales vs employment. This project is based on paper Cobham et al (2019), and accompanying code - both available [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j3p48/).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Context \n",
    "\n",
    "The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is currently developing corporate tax policy reofrms, as explained by Cobham et al (2019) \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"the OECD is consulting on the biggest reshaping of international tax rules for ninety years, following an earlier attempt (through phase 1 of the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting initiative, 2013-2015) to patch up the existing tax rules.\n",
    "Negotiations are ongoing within the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS3 (Inclusive Framework), which brings together 134 countries (both OECD and non- OECD members).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Comissioned by the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT), Cobham et al (2019) analyse the corporate tax reform proposal from the OECD. This is compared to proposals from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and tax justice campaigners. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the data from this paper, which are the current best estimates on corporations sales, employees, and profits, based on country-by-country reporting data released from the US relating to US multinational corporations. The full global data will be released by the OECD in January. This project intends to be update upon this release. \n",

It seems relevant to note here that some there are missing data, particularly for the total tax revenues and corporate tax revenues. These missing values are ignored from calculations, reducing the accuracy of the outcomes from this analysis, however these are the best estimates given the available data.  \n"
